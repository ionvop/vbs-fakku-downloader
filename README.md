Download Fakku stuff for free without needing to pay a single cent through this VBScript program... at the cost of image quality.

All this program does is take advantage of the fact that the thumbnails including the ones that are not visible on the front-end are accessible through their URL, and also the fact that the resolution of the thumbnails is high enough to be mostly readable. I honestly wondered why no one talked about this :v
